 A web project with my buddies trying to figure out HTML, CSS, some Javascript, Servlet and JSP


<---Project1\src\main\webapp--->

Pics - All the test images.

footer.html - Very bad footer which I need to work on.

header.html - Guess what? contains the header.

list.html - Grid view of products.

product.html - Product page.

productExperiment.jsp - Basically product.html in a JSP format, use it change fields from servlet.

Index.html - Just like your existence, useless. I need to delete that.

<---Project1\src\main\webapp\Bootstrap\CSS--->

style.css - The secret sauce!



<---D:\Project\Project1\src\main\java\pkg--->

Product.java - Tried linking header.html, product.html, footer.html using java - worked.

ProductExperiment.java - can spit product page in jsp (productExperiment.jsp) depending on the anchor tag call parameters. 

Run list.html through server and click on first product to understand the above(watch the url too).

    <h1> Return & Exchange Policy </h1>

    <p><b>What is PandaShop 10-day Exchange policy? How does it work?</b></p>
    <p>

        PandaShop's 10-day Exchange policy gives you the option to exchange items purchased from the
        PandaShop website/m-site for any reason within 10 days of receipt of the item. We only ask that you don't
        use the product and preserve its original condition, tags and packaging. You are welcome to try on a product
        but please take adequate measures to preserve its condition.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kindly note, all exchanges are subject to stock availability. Please also note that we only offer size
        exchanges.
        If you wish to exchange your item for an alternate product, we suggest that you return it to obtain store credit
        and purchase the new item separately.

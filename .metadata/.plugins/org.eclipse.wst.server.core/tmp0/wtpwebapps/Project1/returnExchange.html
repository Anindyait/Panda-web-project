				<br>
			    <p><b>What is PandaShop 10-day Exchange policy? How does it work?</b></p>
			    <p>
			
			        PandaShop's 10-day Exchange policy gives you the option to exchange items purchased from the
			        PandaShop website/m-site for any reason within 10 days of receipt of the item. We only ask that you don't
			        use the product and preserve its original condition, tags and packaging. You are welcome to try on a product
			        but please take adequate measures to preserve its condition.
			    </p>
			
			    <p>
			        Kindly note, all exchanges are subject to stock availability. Please also note that we only offer size
			        exchanges.
			        If you wish to exchange your item for an alternate product, we suggest that you return it to obtain store credit
			        and purchase the new item separately.
			
			    </p>
				<br>
				
			    <p><b>The following EXCEPTIONS and RULES apply to our 10-day Exchange Policy:</b></p>
			
			    <ol>

			            packaging intact (e.g. shoes must be packed in the original shoe box).</li>
			        <li>We provide customers a store credit in the form of a Gift Card worth the price of the product(excluding COD
			            charges and GST).</li>
			        <li>The exchange policy allows only size exchanges.</li>
			        <li>Please allow 24 hours post-delivery of your order for your order status to be updated in your PandaShop
			            account.</li>
			        <li>Please check the items, type of Exchange, and other related details carefully. Our courier partner will pick
			            up only the items mentioned at the time of submitting the exchange request by you.</li>
			        <li>In case the items handed over to the courier person don't match the details of the items mentioned in the

			    <p><b>How long will it take for me to receive the refund of my returned product?</b></p>
			    <p>We currently <b>do not have a refund policy</b>. We only accept returns for size exchanges. However, if your
			            desired size is not available we will provide you with a credit voucher against it, the worth will be the
			            product price excluding the shipping charges. In case of faulty items, we will replace it with the correct
			            product.
			    </p>
				<br>
			
			    <p><b>I returned my order and opted to get store credits. How do I apply them?</b></p>
			    <p>
			        Once you return a product to us, we will add the value of your order (minus any shipping and/or COD charges)
			        back to your account as PandaShop Credit Voucher. You can use your credit voucher on future orders at PandaShop
			        India website.<br>At the time of your next purchase, please sign in with your registered email ID and utilize
			        your credit voucher in the apply coupon section. The total amount to be paid by you will be calculated after
			        deducting the credits voucher discount.<br>Please note, a credit voucher cannot be used to cover shipping and
			        COD charges.

			    <p>
			        IMPORTANT!!! We do not have a second exchange policy. However, if you still want to initiate the exchange, an
			        amount of 250 INR will be charged for the second exchange.<br>Also, note the exchange request can be raised only
			        once for one order. Hence please try and check the products carefully you have received in one order before
			        initiating the exchange as we do not provide multiple exchanges for the same order.
			    </p>
			    <br>
			    
			    <p><b>Why did the pick-up of my product fail?</b></p>

			        request will be marked as failed
